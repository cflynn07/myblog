[My notes from reading Docker Deep Dive][1]

### Docker Deep Dive

I started using Docker fairly early, in 2014, while working at Runnable in San
Francisco. Runnable was basically an attempt to build a proprietary SAAS
version of a container orchestration system, like Kubernetes, specifically
focused on development environments. When compose, swarm and Kubernetes came
into existence that essentially was the end of Runnable. The experience of
building a product that pushed Docker to the limits of its capabilities gave
all of us a lot of experience with Docker.

As with most everything I've learned in the world of software, I didn't learn
the subject by reading a manual cover to cover. Instead I just started playing
with it. This approach generally works and is the least frustrating to the
impatient but it comes with a small risk of having knowledge gaps. In an effort
to find and fill any knowledge gaps around Docker I may have had, I decided to
read Docker Deep Dive over a weekend.

Thankfully the only knowledge gaps I really had were around things I don't
really care about, like Windows containers and to an extend Docker Swarm since
I prefer Kubernetes.

I [tracked][2] my reading and it took me ~7 hours to thoroughly read Docker
Deep Dive. Overall the book is comprehensive, well organized and clear. If
you're looking for a resource to get up to speed with Docker quickly, Docker
Deep Dive is a good book.
