### Free as in Freedom 

I just finished reading "Free as in Freedom" by Sam Williams. In 2020 I've read
quite a few technical books. FAIF was a deviation from this trend.

FAIF is a biography of Richard Stallman, activist and founder of the GNU
project and the Free Software Foundation. The book describes Stallman's
childhood and upbringing, his formative years in high school through undergrad
and graduate school at Harvard University and MIT, as well as the origins of
his political beliefs of regarding freedom to modify, share and use software as
one sees fit.

The book is written in such a way that it will appeal to programmers and
non-programmers alike. Having worked as a software engineer for years, I was
familiar with the gist of the GNU, the GPL, the FSF, GNU/Linux's origins, and
Stallman's relationship with Linus Torvalds but FAIF filled in the details immensely.

I also found Stallman's philosophical argument for why software should be "free" (free
as in freedom, not beer) fairly compelling. Rather than try to re-articulate
Stallman's position myself, here's an excerpt from Stallman himself.

<blockquote class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-right: 2rem;" cite="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.en.html">
The existence of software inevitably raises the question of how decisions about its use should be made. For example, suppose one individual who has a copy of a program meets another who would like a copy. It is possible for them to copy the program; who should decide whether this is done? The individuals involved? Or another party, called the “owner”? 
<br />
<br />
Software developers typically consider these questions on the assumption that the criterion for the answer is to maximize developers' profits. The political power of business has led to the government adoption of both this criterion and the answer proposed by the developers: that the program has an owner, typically a corporation associated with its development.
<br />
<br />
I would like to consider the same question using a different criterion: the prosperity and freedom of the public in general.
