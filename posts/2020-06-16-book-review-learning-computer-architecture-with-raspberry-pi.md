###### The computer, a box that follows a plan

Learning Computer Architecture with Raspberry Pi is an approachable, detailed
survey of computing. A sampling of topics covered include microprocessors,
memory, software, networking, 3D graphics, lossless/lossy compression, etc.
Mixed in is a pleasant amount of computing history; how computers evolved from
giant monsters of electromechanical switches to miniscule doped silicon wafers
and transistors.

I'm a software engineer and I went through a university computer science
program, so when I picked up this book I had a decent level of familiarity with
computing. The topics are discussed in detail but not in a non-approachable
manner. I think someone with relatively little background knowledge of
computing would be able to absorb the information easily.

One of the best ways engineers help each other is by building and offering
abstraction layers so anyone that wants to do **anything** doesn't have to know
**everything**. I've operated at a higher level of abstraction, above the
workings of hardware, for quite some time and I wanted to enhance my tree trunk
of knowledge. This book was great. After reading it I feel more aware of the
low level **physics** that support everything I do. Being a general survey of
many topics, after reading this there's clear opportunities for further reading
to go deeper.

The chapter on 3D graphics felt a bit forced, in that it attempted to cover too
many complex topics without sufficient explanation. However this made me decide
to purchase and begin reading another book on 3D graphics. I plan to revisit
the 3D graphics chapter of LCAw/RPi after completing this new book on 3D
graphics to test my understanding improvement.
