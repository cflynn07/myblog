I decided to turn my attention towards general study of algorithms and data
structures. After doing some initial research I found "Algorithms in a
Nutshell" by ___ ___. I started reading with my [time tracking and
quantification approach][1], but half way through the book I became
dissatisfied with the book's writing style and organization. The "in a
nutshell" approach just wasn't doing a great job of explaining algorithmic
concepts. It feels more like a reference manual rather than an educational
text.

I felt like there most likely was a better alternative book on the
subject that I could read to more efficiently learn. I did more research and
purchased "The Algorithm Design Manual" by Steven S. Skiena. I've just started
reading that and already I'm confident it's a more approachable text. My plan
is to finish TADM and compare it to AINN. It will be interesting to see if TADM
is or isn't a complete superset of the information covered in AIAN.
