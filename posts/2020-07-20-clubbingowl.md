10+ years ago, when I left college after studying Computer Science and Business
at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, I tried building my first startup. It
was initially named VibeCompass, later renamed ClubbingOwl. Instead of taking a
normal software engineering job, I spent 2+ years working on this. I became
obsessed and routinely worked 100-hour weeks, frequently working in 24-hour
nonstop stints. I don't think I ever had more than $100 in my bank account.

My obsession was so intense I would work on my laptop until I couldn't stay
awake, then I'd fall asleep in my bed with my laptop, and then the moment I
regained consciousness I would reopen my laptop and resume working. I was
always excited to implement all my ideas and that excitement gave me all the
energy I ever needed to keep going.

As a business, ClubbingOwl was almost a comical failure. I completely ignored
the time honored advice of ship a minimum viable product and get something into
the hands of users to get feedback and iterate as quickly as possible. I spent
two years implementing every feature and premature optimization I could dream
up. The whole time I was thinking "if I make this as awesome as possible
everyone will use it because it's awesome." Well it turns out there was a
fairly big problem with that naive approach. All the nightclubs that use
promoters in the world together don't actually constitute that big of a market.
Also when I actually approached all the nightclubs in North America with this,
they all thought it was great but each of them wanted it to work *slightly*
differently so much so that it was almost impossible to offer ClubbingOwl to
all of them as a multi-tenant application.

It definitely wasn't the healthiest time period in my life, I neglected diet,
sleep, physical fitness and probably do a large degree my mental health. I
lived in my parents' basement and didn't have much of a social life.
Ultimately the business never really got off the ground. I was incredibly young
and naive and I made some very rookie mistakes. The biggest mistake being
"geeking-out" to an extreme degree and fixating on all the
features/improvements/optimizations I could build because they were "awesome"
and I was tunnel-vision obsessed with the code.

### What was it?

ClubbingOwl was platform for nightclub patrons, nightclub promoters and
nightclub staff. It largely built around the Facebook API. Users would
authenticate with their Facebook accounts. It had two sides, a user-facing side
where nightclub patrons could find a promoter to get them on a nightclub's
"guest list" and also see which promoters their Facebook friends were using as
well as a backend side for nightclub promoters, managers and staff to organize
guest lists, table arrangements, email marketing, etc.

As a web application, it was fairly complex. It was my first large-scale
project implemented from scratch. I gained experience implementing complex
database schemas, queue systems and background job processing, distributed
caching, infrastructure, servers, deployments, etc. While the project turned
out to be a total failure as a business, it catapulted my career forward by
giving me a conduit to rapidly enhance my skills.
