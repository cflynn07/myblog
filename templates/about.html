      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a software engineer and digital nomad. I currently live in Taipei,
        Taiwan where I study Chinese and grind everyday out of coffee
        shops. I travel a lot. I try prevent myself from becoming tied down to
        any one place; all my physical possessions fit inside two suitcases.</p>

      <p>I'm passionate about working remotely and I believe software companies
        that embrace a remote-first culture have a serious advantage over
        traditional companies that constrain themselves to geographically
      limited talent pools.</p>

      <p>If you're interested in learning a little more about me, glassdoor
        interviewed me about my experiences working as a digital nomad.</p>

      <h2>About This Blog</h2>
      <p>I started this blog primarily to teach myself. Software engineers are
        constant learners. One of the best ways to solidify your understanding
        of new information is to try and teach it to others.</p>

      <p>Initially I'm going to try and keep this software engineering
        oriented. In the future I'm considering writing about travel related to
        being a digital nomad and maybe my experiences living in Taiwan and
      learning Chinese.</p>

      <p>This is a self-rolled blog I wrote in golang. It's hosted on Google
        Cloud using Kubernetes (GKE). The code is hosted at <a
          href="https://github.com/cflynn07/myblog">cflynn07/myblog</a>. The
        project uses Github Actions for CI/CD and helm as a deployment tool. I chose
        to build this blog from scratch in order to get more experience writing
      golang and working with kubernetes.</p>
